# Neha's Birthday Website Gift 🎁

This is a special interactive birthday website for Neha!

## 🚀 How to Open
Simply double-click **`index.html`** to open it in your browser.

## ⚙️ Customization

### 1. Set the Birthday Date
Open `script.js` in a text editor (like Notepad or TextEdit) and change these lines at the top:
```javascript
const BIRTHDAY_MONTH = 1; // Jan = 0, Feb = 1, ... Dec = 11
const BIRTHDAY_DAY = 14;  // The day of the month
```

### 2. Add the Audio
1. Find a "cute child crying" audio file (MP3 format is best).
2. Rename it to **`cry.mp3`**.
3. Place it in the same folder as `index.html`.

### 3. Change the Photo
The site uses `Neha.png`. If you want to change it, just replace the file with another image named `Neha.png`.

## 🧪 Testing (Secret Mode)
To see the full animation *before* the birthday, open the file in your browser and add `?debug=true` to the end of the URL in the address bar. 

Example:
`file:///Users/sreelakshmi/Documents/NehaBday/index.html?debug=true`

## 💌 Sending the Gift
You can compress this entire folder into a ZIP file and send it to Neha, or host it on a free service like GitHub Pages or Netlify for a customized link!
